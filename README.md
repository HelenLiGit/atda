#Implementation of [Asymmeric-Tritraining for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08400)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

These codes work on Tensorflow 1.3.0
Datasets are downloaded from svhn, mnist, [synthetic digits] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-N5tVpsXW5mT2lvQmV6UE5uNFE/view?usp=sharing)(the dataset does not seem to be publicized by original author now).

### Run experiment
```
python svhn_mnist_train.py
```
